		<p>    Hi! My name is Brad Villacis and I am majoring in Computer Science at the University of California, Berkeley. I am also working towards a certificate of teaching in California for Math and Science. I graduated from Santa Monica College in 2020 with an AS degree in Computer Science, AS-T degree in Mathematics, and an AA in General Science. My educational interests are pedagogy, machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer vision, and Astronomy.</p>
		<p>I am a first generation American college student with immigrant parents from Ecuador. My family is a huge inspiration for my studies and professional life. I couldn't have achieved so much without their help. </p>
		<p>In my free time, I love hanging out with friends, hiking, playing video games, and playing guitar. I built my own PC this past summer, and I designed a Dungeons and Dragons campaign for some friends and I to play. I also danced folklorico (Mexican folk dance) for a year before the pandemic stopped practices.</p>

    		Over the summer of 2019, I worked in the graduate aerospace lab (GALCIT) at Caltech. While there I worked on updated autonomous position correcting code based of the image data collected and processed by the drone. Here you see the drone trying to maintain it's altitude around the Aruco marker which was the object it used to figure out it's x,y, and z positions.

    		Over the spring semester of 2018, my fellow interns and I engineered a replica of the Mars rover, Curiosity. We all worked on the mechanical, electrical, and programming components equally with some taking on lead roles. I and another intern took on the lead for programming.

    		From the fall of 2020 to the summer of 2021, I worked with a team of UC Berkeley students to participate in NASA's SAVER program in which we are tasked to create a model of an autonomous boat that would be used in the Artemis missions to save astronauts as they entered Earth's atomoshpere and landed in the water. While I did very little programming on this project, I am part of the team that will present a lesson plan to fourth and fifth grade students in the Bay area. The lesson plan will cover topics we need to use to make the boat successful (buoyancy, energy, etc.).

    		<p>Through my classes, I have worked on some really fun projects. </p>
    		<p> I worked on the Python scripts to make a game similar to Plants v. Zombies. A couple of these mechanics were health, ranged attacks, physical attacks, and win conditions. </p>
    		<p> Another one I worked on using Java was implementing Git and its functions including "add," "commit," "log," "checkout," "status," and "branch." I worked with storing and retrieving data locally. </p>
    		<p> The other Java project was to create an auto generated world complete with a renderer, map, characters, and music.</p>
